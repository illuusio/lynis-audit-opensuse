# lynis-audit-opensuse
These config files make Lynis (https://cisofy.com/lynis/) auditing tool happier.

If you install these file and tools down there you should get something like 70%-80%
in Lynis audit. These file are for openSUSE but it you find them useful to you in 
some other Linux distribution be most welcome.

## Read this before making life harder than it is
*These files don't make you system safer*. They don't prevent any thread or
try force you to make changes how you roll your system.
If you are like me. You just run Lynis time to time just to make sure basic
stuff is ok in system. *I don't say these files are best/better/ultimate exmples*.
They are just starting point to everlasting jorney to that point where I can unplug
my servers from Internet and at last feel *safe*.
So feel free to upgrade and tune them with PR.
AND YES I DON'T HAVE A GLUE ABOUT SYSTEM SECURITY OR HOW TO BE SYSADMIN
so don't point that out if you just can.
